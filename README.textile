h2. "Building It" Tutorial 

Thanks to Daniel Kehoe aka "fortuity":https://github.com/fortuity

A complete walkthrough tutorial is available on the Daniel Kehoe's and Fernando Tapia Rico's (me) wiki:

h4. "Rails3-Mongoid-Devise walkthrough tutorial":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise/wiki/Tutorial-%28Walkthrough%29

h4. "OmniAuth Installation Tutorial":https://github.com/fertapric/rails3-mongoid-devise-omniauth/wiki/OmniAuth-Installation-Tutorial

The tutorial documents each step to follow to create the application. Every step is documented concisely, so a complete beginner can create this application without any additional knowledge. However, no explanation is offered for any of the steps, so if you are a beginner, youâ€™re advised to look for an introduction to Rails elsewhere. Refer to the "Rails Guides":http://guides.rubyonrails.info/ site for help if you are a beginner. Or read Michael Hartl's "Ruby on Rails Tutorial":http://railstutorial.org/ book.

If you simply wish to modify the application for your own project, you can download the application and set it up as described below, without following the tutorial.
